  	<p>I am currently an aspiring photographer and Graphic Designer. I hope to specialize in website design and content creation. I am a second year student in the Multimedia Arts program at BMCC. My goal upon graduation is to work for an established and stable company showcasing the skills that I have learned as an Undergraduate and to grow and evolve as an artist. I love cats.
